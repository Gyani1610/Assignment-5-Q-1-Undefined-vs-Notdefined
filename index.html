    <h2>Differance between Undefined,Defined and Not defined</h2>

    <h3><b style="color: red;"> Undefine: </b><br>
        It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything
        which gets a space in memory will contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.
    </h3>

    <h3><b style="color: red;">Not defined</b> <br>
         In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript
        will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.
    </h3>
